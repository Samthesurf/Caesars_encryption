# Small Python Projects
This repository contains a collection of small Python projects that I created as part of my learning process. Each project is designed to showcase a different aspect of Python programming and to help me improve my skills.

# Caesar Cipher
The Caesar Cipher project is a Python script that can encode or decode words using a simple algorithm. The script shifts the letters of a word forward or backward based on a set number of positions, repeating the process as many times as desired. This project helped me to better understand string manipulation and algorithms.

# Namemashup.py
The namemashup.py project is a Python script that I created while working through Anna Bell's "Learning Python" book. 
The script uses string slicing to scramble parts of someone's name and surname, generating a fun and unique "mashup" of the two. This project helped me to better understand string slicing and manipulation.

# Checking for Prime Numbers
The Checking for Prime Numbers project is a simple Python function that I created to check whether a given number is prime or not.
This project helped me to better understand basic programming constructs and functions.
